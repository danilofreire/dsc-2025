## What is the "hidden curriculum"? 🤔

:::{style="font-size: 23px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- [Philip Jackson (1968)](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Life_in_Classrooms/W46Gu6wwYsQC?hl=en) argued that schools do more than just teach academic content
- They also transmit [social norms, values, and expectations that are not explicitly stated in the formal curriculum]{.alert}
- To succeed, you need to understand and [navigate this hidden curriculum]{.alert}
- Formal Curriculum: "_Read Chapter 4 and write a summary._"
- Hidden Curriculum: "_You must write this summary using a specific, formal academic tone; you should know that asking for an extension 24 hours before the deadline is acceptable, but 1 hour before is not; and you should know that visiting my office hours to discuss it will likely improve your grade, even though 'visiting office hours' isn't on the rubric._"

## Why does it matter for you?

:::{style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 30px;"}
- The hidden curriculum creates [an equity gap]{.alert} 
- Students whose families have a history of higher education learn those rules informally
- First-generation, low-income, foreigners, or those unfamiliar with academia or labour markets [may struggle]{.alert}
- This can be a major [source of anxiety]{.alert} and [self-doubt]{.alert} even for high-achievers
- Many students, including myself, have learned these rules through [trial and error, often making mistakes along the way]{.alert}
- More information here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_curriculum>

:::{.incremental}
- [But don't worry]{.alert}, I'm here to help you navigate it! 🤓

## GitHub to the rescue!

:::{style="font-size: 22px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- [GitHub.com](https://github.com) is the world's largest platform for [hosting and collaborating on code]{.alert}
- Think about it as Google Docs for code
- But it's also [much more than that!]{.alert}
- It has become a [de facto portfolio]{.alert} for data scientists, programmers, and other professionals
- Employers often look at candidates' GitHub profiles to [assess their skills and experience]{.alert}
- Having a strong GitHub presence can [set you apart]{.alert} from other candidates
- As we will see shortly, it can help you [credibly demonstrate your programming and soft skills]{.alert}, [indicate that you are proactive and consistent]{.alert}, and [show that you are a great team player!]{.alert}
- If you don't have a GitHub account yet, [create one now!]{.alert}

## An (extremely brief) introduction to Git and GitHub

:::{style="font-size: 24px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control system that helps you track changes to your code over time
- It allows you to [collaborate with others]{.alert} on coding projects
- [GitHub](https://github.com) is a web-based platform that uses Git to help you manage and share your code repositories
- You can [create repositories]{.alert} (online folders), [add files]{.alert}, [commit changes]{.alert} (write messages about what you changed), and [push updates]{.alert} (upload changes to GitHub)
- You can also [collaborate with others]{.alert} by [forking repositories]{.alert} (copying someone else's repo), [making pull requests]{.alert} (suggesting changes), and [reviewing code]{.alert}
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
- Install Git (<https://git-scm.com/downloads>) and set up your GitHub account
- To create a new repository, click the "+" icon in the top right corner of GitHub and select "New repository"
- Name your repository, add a description, and choose whether to make it public or private
- To clone a repository to your local machine, open your terminal and use the command `git clone <repository-url>`
- To add files, use `git add <file-name>`; to commit changes, use `git commit -m "Your commit message"`; and to push updates, use `git push origin main`

## Github Desktop

:::{style="font-size: 27px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- If the terminal is too intimidating, you can use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) instead
- It provides a [graphical user interface]{.alert} for managing your repositories
- You can do (almost) everything you would do in the terminal, but with buttons and menus
- Great for beginners and to get started quickly!
- Download it here: <https://desktop.github.com/> and read the documentation: <https://docs.github.com/en/desktop>

- A degree gets you in the door...
- [Proof gets you the job]{.alert}!
- CVs say "I can do this." [GitHub says "Look, I *did* this."]{.alert}
- Employers want to see [evidence of your skills]{.alert}, not just claims
- Don't just list "Python" or "Project Management" on LinkedIn
- Link to a Repo where [you actually used Python or managed a project]{.alert}
- Reduces hiring risk for employers and makes you a more compelling candidate
- Data analysts: [for you it's not optional]{.alert}!
- Business analysts and other non-technical roles: [you understand modern workflows and can manage your projects without the chaos]{.alert}

## Anatomy of a good repository

:::{style="font-size: 23px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- A good repository should have:
  - A clear and descriptive [name]{.alert} (e.g., `market-trends-latam-2025`)
  - An [informative description]{.alert} summarising the project's purpose
  - A [detailed README file]{.alert} that explains the project, its purpose, and how to use it
  - [Folders]{.alert} organising code, data, and documentation
  - Well-organised [code with comments]{.alert} explaining key sections
  - A [license file]{.alert} specifying how others can use your code
  - [Issues and pull requests]{.alert} demonstrating collaboration and problem-solving (if applicable)

## `.gitignore` files
### Stop committing junk!

:::{style="font-size: 24px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- A `.gitignore` file tells Git which [files or folders to ignore when committing changes]{.alert}
- This is important to avoid committing unnecessary or sensitive files, such as:
  - Temporary files (e.g., `.DS_Store`, `thumbs.db`)
  - Environment files (e.g., `env/`, `venv/`, `.env`)
  - Large data files that shouldn't be in the repository
  - [API keys or passwords]{.alert}
- You can create a `.gitignore` file manually or use templates from [gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore) (recommended)

## Git commit etiquette
### Write good commit messages

:::{style="font-size: 28px; margin-top: 30px;"}
- A good commit message should be:
  - [Clear and concise]{.alert}: summarise the changes in a few words
  - [Descriptive]{.alert}: explain why the change was made, not just what was changed
  - [Consistent]{.alert}: follow a standard format for all commit messages
- [Bad]{.alert}: "fixed stuff", "typo", "final version"
- [Good]{.alert}: "Fix calculation error in revenue model", "Update README with installation steps", "Add unit tests for data processing functions"
- [The rule]{.alert}: use the Imperative Mood ("Add", not "Added")
:::

## `README.md` files: Your project's front page
### Make a strong first impression!

:::{style="font-size: 24px; margin-top: 30px;"}
- The README file is the [first thing visitors see]{.alert} when they visit your repository
- It should provide a clear overview of the project, including:
  - Project title and description
  - Installation instructions
  - Usage examples
  - Contribution guidelines (if applicable)
  - Contact information
  - License information

- A well-crafted README can make a strong first impression and encourage others to check your work
- It also shows [soft skills]{.alert} like communication, attention to detail, and professionalism
- Learn [how to use Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to format your README effectively
- Use your LLM of choice too!

# Collaborating on GitHub 🤝 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## The `feature-branch` workflow

:::{style="font-size: 21px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- Collaborating on GitHub often involves using [branches]{.alert}
- A branch is a [separate version of the codebase]{.alert} where you can work on new features or fixes without affecting the main code
- [The `main` branch]{.alert} (or `master` in older repositories) should only contain [stable, production-ready code]{.alert}. [Don't mess it up!]{.alert} 😂
- Create a new branch for each feature or fix you work on (e.g., `feature-login`, `bugfix-typo`, `new-module`)
- If you're working by yourself, branches are not strictly necessary, but they are a good habit to develop
- When you're done with your changes, you can [open a pull request]{.alert} to merge your branch back into `main`
- This allows for [code review]{.alert} and discussion before changes are integrated
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
:::{style="font-size: 17px; text-align: center;"}
```
1. Create a new branch from `main`
git checkout -b feature-branch

2. Check if you are on the new branch
git branch

3. Make changes and commit them
git add <file-name>
git commit -m "Add new feature that does X, Y, and Z"

4. Push the branch to GitHub
git push origin feature-branch

5. Open a pull request on GitHub to merge `feature-branch` into `main`
```

## Pull requests and issues

:::{style="font-size: 27px; margin-top: 30px;"}
- A pull request (PR) is [a request to merge changes from one branch into another]{.alert}
- PRs allow for [discussion and review of code changes]{.alert} before they are integrated
- When you open a PR, [provide a clear description of the changes you made and why]{.alert}
- This is also an opportunity to [showcase your communication skills]{.alert}
- [Issues]{.alert} are used to [comment on bugs, suggest new features, or ask questions]{.alert}
- They are [not as useful to your profile as pull requests]{.alert}, but it shows that you are engaged and proactive
- More information here: <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests> and <https://docs.github.com/en/issues>

- Any employer can [see your contributions]{.alert} to public repositories on GitHub
- How? GitHub [automatically tracks contributions]{.alert} based on commits, pull requests, and issues
- To ensure your contributions are counted:
- [Use the same email address]{.alert} for Git commits as the one associated with your GitHub account
- Make sure your [commits are pushed to the repository on GitHub]{.alert}
- Your contributions will then appear on your GitHub profile under the "Contributions" section and if you click on "Insights" > "Contributors" in a repository
- This is how [you can verify your work history]{.alert} (show, don't tell, remember?)

- Finally, let's talk about [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- GitHub Pages allows you to [host static websites directly from your GitHub repositories]{.alert}
- You can use it to, of course, [showcase your projects, portfolio, or blog]{.alert}
- It's free and you get a custom URL too: `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/`
- You can use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), or even plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- This is probably [the most impressive way]{.alert} to demonstrate your skills and projects to potential employers
- Even a simple website or portfolio can make a big difference!
- More information here: <https://docs.github.com/en/pages>

## Your first portfolio in 5 minutes
### The "fork" strategy

:::{style="font-size: 19px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- Building a website from scratch (HTML/CSS) is hard and time-consuming
- The "Hacker" way: [Don't start from scratch. Fork a template!]{.alert}
- **Step 1:** Find a Jekyll theme you like (e.g., [online-cv](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv) or [academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io))
- **Step 2:** Click the "Fork" button (top right) to copy it to your account
- **Step 3:** Rename the repository to `yourusername.github.io`
- **Step 4:** Edit the `_config.yml` (or `data.yml` in some projects) file to add your name and details
- **Step 5:** Commit the changes, go to "Settings" > "Pages", and select the `main` (or `master`) branch as the source
- **Result:** You have a professional website live at `https://yourusername.github.io`!
- Search for "Jekyll themes" on Google to find more templates, such as <https://jekyllthemes.io/free>

- Let's see how this works in practice!
- I will show you how to fork a template repository
- Then we'll edit the configuration file together
- Finally, we'll deploy the site and see it live
- This is exactly what you can do in [less than 5 minutes]{.alert}
- No coding experience required!
- I will use the [online-cv template](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv) for this demo

# Final thoughts 🧠 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Summary: how to use GitHub to boost your career

:::{style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 30px;"}
- GitHub helps you [navigate this hidden curriculum]{.alert}
- [Your code is better than claims]{.alert}: Let your repositories demonstrate your technical abilities
- [Documentation proves communication skills]{.alert}: Write good, detailed README files, including your personal profile README
- [Pull requests prove teamwork]{.alert}: Show you can work in professional environments
- [Consistency builds credibility]{.alert}: Regular commits show you're proactive when nobody is grading you
- [Your portfolio showcases your best work]{.alert}: GitHub Pages transforms your repositories into a website
- You go from a candidate with claims into a candidate with proof!
:::

## The professional checklist
### Before you send your link to a recruiter...

:::{style="font-size: 24px; margin-top: 30px;"}
- [Clean up your repository names]{.alert}: `final_project_v2` looks like a school assignment. `predictive-maintenance-model` looks like professional work
- [Pin your best work and check your profile README]{.alert}: Use the "Customise your pins" feature to showcase your best repositories
- [Test all your links]{.alert}: Does that live demo actually load? Broken links look unprofessional
- [Add a license]{.alert}: MIT license is a great default
- [Curate your gallery]{.alert}: Make those half-finished "hello world" experiments private. Your profile should tell [a story of competence and completion]{.alert}
- [Check your commit history]{.alert}: A profile with small, regular commits looks like a career. One massive commit from 6 months ago looks like you forgot about GitHub until yesterday
- And finally...

:::{.incremental}
- [Don't forget to smile]{.alert}! Have fun along the way 😊
- I'm already rooting for all of you!
